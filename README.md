# Kashmiri Language Translation

The Kashmiri Language Translation project focuses on developing a high-quality machine translation system for Kashmiri. We are curating a diverse dataset and using advanced machine learning techniques to improve translation accuracy. The project aims to create a scalable system benefiting the Kashmiri-speaking community.

## Dataset  
We have successfully concatenated and structured all collected data into a single CSV file named **`dataset.csv`**. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating our machine translation models.
